# ‚úÖ Tier CLI Action

## About

This action configures the [Tier CLI](https://tier.run) within GitHub's hosted Actions runners.

## Usage

Setup the `tier` CLI and pass the respective version:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: openformation/setup-tier-cli-action@v1
    with:
      version: "0.12.0"
```

Afterwards, you can use the `tier` CLI in subsequent steps:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: openformation/setup-tier-cli-action@v1
    with:
      version: "0.12.0"
  - run: tier push ...
```
